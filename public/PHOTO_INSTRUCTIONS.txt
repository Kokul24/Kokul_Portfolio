HOW TO ADD YOUR PROFILE PHOTO
==============================

To display your profile photo on the homepage:

1. Prepare your photo:
   - Use a square image (recommended: 500x500 pixels or larger)
   - Ensure good quality and proper lighting
   - Crop the image to focus on your face

2. Name your photo file as: profile-photo.jpg
   (You can also use .png format, just update the file extension in Home.js)

3. Place the photo in this folder (public folder)
   Location: c:\Users\KOKUL M\OneDrive\Attachments\Desktop\Kokul_Portfolio\public\

4. The photo will automatically appear on the homepage with a green circular border and animations

Alternative formats supported:
- profile-photo.png
- profile-photo.jpeg

If using a different format, update line 74 in src/pages/Home/Home.js:
Change: src="/profile-photo.jpg"
To: src="/profile-photo.png" (or your format)

Note: The placeholder will show until you add your photo.
